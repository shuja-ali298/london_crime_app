#### Description:
Welcome to the London Crime Data Dashboard! This project is a web-based application designed to provide insights and analysis of crime data in London. Using this dashboard, users can:

- **View Crime Data by Type:** Explore detailed statistics about different crime types throughout various months. Users can interact with the plot, by selecting and de-selecting the types of crimes they want to see trends for.
- **Total Crimes Overview:** Get an overview of total crimes categorized by borough and year. Users can interact with the plot, by selecting and de-selecting the boroughs they want to see the trends for.
- **Dataset Overview:** Access and interact with a comprehensive dataset, including filtering and pagination options.

The **London Crime Data Dashboard** was created to address the need for an intuitive and user-friendly tool to visualize and analyze crime data. With the increasing availability of public crime datasets, there is a growing demand for applications that can effectively manage and present this data in a meaningful way. By offering a web-based interface for accessing and exploring crime statistics, this project aims to contribute to community awareness, support law enforcement efforts, and foster research into crime trends and prevention strategies.

The dashboard leverages modern web technologies and data processing techniques to provide a seamless user experience, making it easier for individuals and organizations to gain insights from crime data and make informed decisions based on the analysis.

## Features:
- **Interactive Data Filtering:** Filter data by borough and crime type.
- **Month-based Selection:** Choose specific months to display in the dataset view.
- **Pagination:** Navigate through large datasets with ease using pagination controls.
- **Default Views:** View default data for May 2024 to June 2024.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for Python, used to create the web application.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight database used to store crime data.
- **Pandas:** A data analysis library for Python, used to process and load data into the SQLite database.
- **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework for creating responsive and visually appealing web designs.

## Instructions

### **1. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use the following `bash` commands to install required packages:

```bash
